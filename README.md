<h1>Decode Substitution Cipher with Frequency Letter Analysis</h1>

I implemented a cryptogram decoder that deciphers a classic substitution cipher.
The substitution cipher encodes texts by using the method of replacing each letter to another cipher letter.
The original calculated time complexity of decoding the substitution cipher is 26 !, so I reduced decoding time by using the frequency letter analysis which can decipher the most common letters in the code with the most frequent letters in English.
To get more accurate result, the most common 2-letter pairs and 3-letter triples techniques also can be used.
